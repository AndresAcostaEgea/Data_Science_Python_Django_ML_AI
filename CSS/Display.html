    <p>Symphyotrichum lateriflorum,  calico or starved aster, <span>is a perennial plant in the family Asteraceae found in North America. </span> Its flowers are small, at about 13 millimeters (0.51 in) in diameter when in full bloom. It has seven to fifteen white ray florets that surround a group of about eight to sixteen cream to light yellow disk florets. After pollination, the disk florets may turn pink, then purple or light brown. Its late-summer and fall flowers are visited by small pollinators and nectar-seeking insects such as sweat bees, miner bees, and hoverflies. The leaves have fine veins and little to no hair except for the key characteristic of hair on the back midrib. The plant was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Solidago lateriflora. The Meskwaki and Potawatomi have used the plant medicinally and in sweatbaths. It was cultivated in Europe by 1758, and modern-day cultivars include 'Bleke Bet', 'Lady in Black', and 'Prince'.</p>
